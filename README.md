# **project0 PesaPal Challange 2023**

project0 is implementing an assembler following provided machine instruction set by PesaPal Careers Portal for Junior Developer . The project has two parts

### **1. Assembler**

Has five registers and 64K of memory in a 32-bit address space, from ***0x00000000â€“0x0000FFFF***  

Has five registers consist of three general purpose **(R1, R2, R3)**, program counter (instruction pointer) register **(PC)**, and a conditional register **(COND)**

Each instruction is encoded in a half word (16 bits) in little endian *(stores the least-significant byte at the smallest address)*

* first 4 bits (half byte)- contain the instruction number
* second, third and fourth half-bytes (4 bit sections) contain register numbers

 Takes text assembly program written for the above instruction set and produces the output as a set of 16-bit numbers, bytecode format

### **2. Simulator to process assembler output**

The program takes the output of the assembler and execute it, correctly.

# How to install and run

git clone the repo

# How to use

## can be used in 3 modes

Only mode one is complete

### **1. see complete preprocessed assembly file infomation**

Displays informatio of preprocessed assembly file. Preprocessing is the first step that the assembly file goes through where comments are eliminated, subroutines identified among other steps.

```sh
 python3 run.py read test.txt
```

test.txt should be a file containing assembly source code an example is shown below:

```s
; a simple counter program.
li R1 0x00000000
; end
li R2 0x0000FFFF
; memory location of loop start
li R3 loop
loop:
  ; store the contents of R1 at the memory location pointed by R1
  sw R1 R1
  ; increment the counter
  inc R1
  ; loop if the counter hasn't yet reached the end
  bne R1 R2 R3
  ; end program
  halt
```

### **2. compile an assembly file source code to byte code**

Specify the source file and destination file.

```sh
python3 run.py make test.txt compiled.s
```

or

```sh
python3 run.py make test.txt compiled.obj
```

Intermediate compiled file is first generated and then converted into instruction in bytes.
  
Intermediate compiled file result looks as shown below:

```sh
 0x02 R1 0x00000000
 0x02 R2 0x0000FFFF
 0x02 R3 0x60
 0x04 R1 R1
 0x0D R1
 0x0C R1 R2 R3
 0x00
```

### **3. Run simulator to prosses byte code or obj file**

Coming soon.

My refernce stems from some work I did earlier on a MIPS-Assembler [(https://github.com/Sammy-Barasa/MIPS-Assembler)](https://github.com/Sammy-Barasa/MIPS-Assembler) see details on this link.

project0 features a unique instruction set, an improved program structure and documentation, a more efficient preprocessing stage, tests and a simulator.

### The Art of Assembly Language, 2nd Edition by Randall Hyde

One of my fundamental learning material used for referencing and understanding the assembler. The Art of Assembly Language has provided a comprehensive, plain-English, and patient introduction to 32-bit x86 assembly for non-assembly programmers. Hyde's primary teaching tool, High Level Assembler (or HLA), incorporates many of the features found in high-level languages (like C, C++, and Java) to help you quickly grasp basic assembly concepts. HLA lets you write true low-level code while enjoying the benefits of high-level language programming.
